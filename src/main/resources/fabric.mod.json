  "description": "Fabric mod made using the GeckoLib Mod. I want the mod to have 10 of the exact same basic mobs. Basically each mob just needs to be a wolf but use the geckolib modeling assets. The 10 basic mobs will be neutral mobs where they do not attack the player unless provoked. They must be tamable with a bone (or if an item can be set with the config, that would be better). They will have the same animations that wolves would have plus some extras.  Normal Animations 1: Walk 2: Run 3: Sit 4: Idle 5: Attack",
